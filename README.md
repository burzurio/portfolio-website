# Personal Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website that showcases my progress as an aspiring software engineer and computer science major.  

The website includes:
- My resume
- Links to my socials
- A showcase of projects and updates as I continue my career journey  

I built this site using HTML and CSS for styling. I plan to keep updating it throughout my career.
